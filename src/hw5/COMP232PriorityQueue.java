 * interface. The key that comes later in the ordering imposed by the compareTo 
 * method appeats at the head of the priority queue.
 * 
 * For example, if Integers or Doubles are used as the key, then larger keys 
 * will be at the head of the queue. Note that for the same reason, if Strings 
 * are used as keys, then words that come later in the dictionary will be at the
 * head of the queue.
